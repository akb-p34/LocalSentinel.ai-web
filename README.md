# LocalSentinel.ai - Landing Page

## üõ°Ô∏è Offline Code Security, Right in VS Code

LocalSentinel.ai is a VS Code extension that performs comprehensive security audits of your codebase entirely offline. This repository contains the landing page for the LocalSentinel.ai project, showcasing our one-click offline code audit solution that runs directly in VS Code.

## üìã Project Overview

LocalSentinel.ai provides developers with:
- **100% Offline Operation**: All scanning and AI analysis happens locally on your machine
- **One-Click Security Audits**: Simple command to scan your entire repository
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses DeepSeek-coder-v2-lite-instruct to explain issues and propose fixes
- **Clear, Actionable Reports**: Red/Yellow/Green severity ratings with copy-ready fix suggestions
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with no setup required

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Static Analysis + AI Intelligence
- Multi-language vulnerability detection using Semgrep
- Python security checks with Bandit
- Smart regex pattern matching for secrets, debug flags, and security misconfigurations
- AI-powered triage to reduce false positives and explain findings in plain English

### Developer-Friendly Reporting
- Clean report interface directly in VS Code
- Jump-to-code functionality for each finding
