# Future Features Roadmap

## Demo Applications Showcase

### Overview
Add a dedicated section on the landing page to showcase three intentionally vulnerable demo applications that demonstrate LocalSentinel's detection capabilities.

### Demo Applications

#### 1. E-Commerce Platform (ShopZilla)
- **Description**: Online marketplace with intentional security vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerabilities to Showcase**:
  - Client-side price manipulation
  - SQL injection in search
  - Hardcoded API keys
  - XSS in review system
  - Payment processing vulnerabilities

#### 2. Chess Game (KnightMove.io)
- **Description**: Multiplayer chess application with security flaws
- **Vulnerabilities to Showcase**:
  - eval() remote code execution
  - MongoDB injection
  - Exposed JWT secrets
  - Weak cryptography
  - Admin panel bypass

#### 3. Banking Dashboard (SecureBank)
- **Description**: Financial application with authentication issues
- **Vulnerabilities to Showcase**:
  - Authentication bypass
  - Path traversal
  - IDOR vulnerabilities
  - Session management issues
  - Data exposure

### Implementation Notes
- Each demo should be fully functional but contain intentional vulnerabilities
- Include a warning banner about not deploying to production
- Provide guided walkthroughs showing how LocalSentinel detects each issue
- Show before/after comparisons with LocalSentinel fixes applied

### Component Structure
The `DemoShowcase.tsx` component has already been created and can be re-added to the landing page when ready:
- Located in `/src/components/DemoShowcase.tsx`
- To enable: Add back to `App.tsx` imports and render in appropriate location
